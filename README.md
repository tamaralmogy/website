## Q2: jQuery 

jQuery is a lightweight JavaScript library commonly used in web development to simplify programming tasks on websites. It offers a variety of features aimed at streamlining common tasks such as DOM manipulation, event handling, Ajax interactions, animations, and cross-browser compatibility.

### Key Features:

- **DOM Manipulation**: Simplifies selecting and modifying HTML elements in the Document Object Model (DOM).
- **Event Handling**: Provides methods for attaching event handlers to HTML elements.
- **Ajax Interactions**: Offers streamlined methods for making asynchronous HTTP requests to the server.
- **Animations and Effects**: Includes built-in functions for creating animations and effects on web pages.


## Q3: Whack a Mole

This JavaScript code implements a simple "Whack-a-Mole" game. 

- **setGame()**: Sets up the game board by creating a 3x3 grid of tiles.
- **setMole()**: Places a mole randomly on one of the tiles every second.
- **setPlant()**: Places a plant randomly on one of the tiles every two seconds.
- **selectTile()**: Handles tile clicks. If the clicked tile contains a mole, increments the score; if it contains a plant, ends the game and displays the final score.

## Q4: Form

If server-side functionality were added, the contact form would:

- Validate user input, ensuring required fields are filled and data is correctly formatted.
- Sending email notifications to the website owner.
- Potentially store the form data in a database for future reference or analysis.
- Enhance the contact form by providing validation, data processing, email notifications, and confirmation messages.
